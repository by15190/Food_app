# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice: Firebase Cloud Storage Issue

This app was originally designed to store and retrieve images using Firebase Cloud Storage. However, due to Firebase's recent policy change, Cloud Storage now requires a paid **Blaze Plan**, which is not available on the free **Spark Plan**.

## üöÄ Workarounds & Next Steps

### üîÑ Alternative Storage Solutions
- The app can be modified to use **Cloudinary, Imgur, Supabase, or local storage** for images.
- Future updates may integrate a free cloud storage service.

### üõ† How to Run the App Without Firebase Storage
- If you want to test the app, you can manually replace Firebase image URLs with **local assets** or a **free hosting service**.

### üßê Code Review
- The **image retrieval logic** is already implemented.
- If Firebase Cloud Storage is enabled (**Blaze Plan**), it will work as expected.
